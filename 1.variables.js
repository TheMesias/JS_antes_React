//var don't use for programming 
//because you can access to value before of declaration, it's bad programmation 
console.log(variable); 
var variable = "hello"; 

//instead use let you only can access to value after declaration 
let variLet = 25; 
console.log(variLet); 

//for use const you should initialize the variable with value 
const varConst = 20; 
console.log(varConst);
